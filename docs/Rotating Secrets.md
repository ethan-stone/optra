A client can have at most two secrets at a time. When choosing to rotate a secret, an expiration date can be chosen for the current secret, or it can expire immediately.

When a secret expires, the version of the client is incremented, thus invalidating any JWTs that are on the older version. A message should be published to all servers so they can remove cached clients, so the next time they are verified they can be freshly retrieved.
