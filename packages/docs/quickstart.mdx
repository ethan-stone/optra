## Sign up for a Phractal account

<Warning>ADD SCREENSHOTS</Warning>

Navigate to [Phractal](https://phractal.xyz) and sign up for an account. A free
"Personal" workspace will be created for you automatically.

## Create your first API

Once signed up, you'll be at the root of the dashboard. Here you'll be able to create and see your APIs.

To create a new APIs, click the "Create API" button in the top right corner. A modal will appear where you can give your API a name and select the JWT signing algorithm. You can either select HS256 or RS256.

### Signing Algorithms

<Warning>ADD SCREENSHOTS</Warning>

There are two signing algorithms supported:

- HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)
- RS256 (RSA with SHA-256)

HS256 is a symmetric algorithm, where the same secret is used for signing and verifying the JWT tokens.

RS256 is an asymmetric algorithm, where a private key is used to sign the tokens and a public key is used to verify them.

Generally, we recommend using RS256. But view the use cases section of our documentation to see what fits best.

## Create your first client

<Warning>ADD SCREENSHOTS</Warning>

Once your API is created, you'll be able to create clients for it. Clients are the entities that will be using your API. For example, if you're building a mobile app, you might create a client for each platform (iOS, Android, etc.).
