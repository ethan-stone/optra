## Sign up for a Phractal account

<Warning>ADD SCREENSHOTS</Warning>

Navigate to [Phractal](https://phractal.xyz) and sign up for an account. A free
"Personal" workspace will be created for you automatically.

## Create your first API

Once signed up, you'll be at the root of the dashboard. Here you'll be able to create and see your APIs.

To create a new APIs, click the "Create API" button in the top right corner. A modal will appear where you can give your API a name and select the JWT signing algorithm. You can either select HS256 or RS256.

### Signing Algorithms

<Warning>ADD SCREENSHOTS</Warning>

There are two signing algorithms supported:

- HS256 (HMAC with SHA-256)
- RS256 (RSA with SHA-256)

HS256 is a symmetric algorithm, where the same secret is used for signing and verifying the JWT tokens.

RS256 is an asymmetric algorithm, where a private key is used to sign the tokens and a public key is used to verify them.

Generally, we recommend using RS256. But view the use cases section of our documentation to see what fits best.

After creating your API, you'll be redirected to the API's page.

## Create your first client

<Warning>ADD SCREENSHOTS</Warning>

Now you can create a client for your API. A client is a set of credentials that can be used to obtain an access token, and thus authenticate with your API.

You can create a client by clicking the "Clients" tab on the API's page, and then the "Create Client" button. You can give a name for the client, and optionally provide prefixes for the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` that will be generated.

<Note>
An underscore (`_`) will be added between the prefix and the generated ID/secret if you provide a prefix, so there is no need to include one in the input.

For example, if you provide the prefix `pk` for the `Client ID Prefix` and `sk` for the `Client Secret Prefix`, the generated `Client ID` will be `pk_<random>`, and the generated `Client Secret` will be `sk_<random>`.

</Note>

After submitting the form, a modal will appear with the generated `Client ID` and `Client Secret`.

<Warning>
  Make sure to save the `Client Secret` in a secure location, as it will not be
  shown again.
</Warning>

Now with a client created, in the next section we'll go over how to obtain an access token.

## Obtaining an access token

Obtaining an access token is as simple as sending the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` to our oauth token endpoint.

```shell Example cURL request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.phractal.xyz/v1/oauth/token \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <token>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "clientId": "<string>",
  "clientSecret": "<string>",
  "grantType": "client_credentials"
}'
```

This will response with a payload containing an access token, how much time until the token expires, the type of token, and the scope of the token.

```json Example response
{
  "accessToken": "<string>",
  "tokenType": "<string>",
  "expiresIn": 123,
  "scope": "<string>"
}
```
